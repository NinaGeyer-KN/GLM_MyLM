## Part 1: Explanatory analysis of the dataset

```{r cars, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("car")
library(car)
library(GGally)

ggpairs(SLID)

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
